Diffable is a method for reducing page load latency by transmitting differential
encodings of static files. It works by sending deltas between versions of files
that reside in a browser's cache. In web applications, files such as Javascript,
HTML, and CSS are often updated every week or more, but change very little
between versions. This method significantly reduces the bandwidth and
transmission time for these files and is implementable on all legacy browsers
that support Javascript.

To build Diffable from source requires Apache Maven 2.1 or better:
http://maven.apache.org/

It also requires Java EE 6 or better:
http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/index.jsp

The following 3rd party libraries must exist on the classpath when building
from source and must also be linked from web projects that use diffable-0.1.jar:

Google Guice 2.0 or better:
 - guice-2.0.jar : http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/

AOP Alliance 1.0 or better:
 - aopalliance.jar : http://sourceforge.net/projects/aopalliance/

Objenesis 1.2 or better:
 - objenesis-1.2.jar : http://code.google.com/p/objenesis/

Apache Commons IO 1.4 or better:
 - commons-io-1.4.jar : http://commons.apache.org/io/
 
Log4J 1.2 or better:
 - log4j-1.2.16.jar : http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/
 
The following 3rd party apps are not required when using Diffable but are
required when building from source:

EasyMock 3.0 or better:
 - easymock-3.0.jar : http://easymock.org/

Code Generation Library 2.2 or better:
 - cglib-nodep-2.2.jar : http://cglib.sourceforge.net/
 
Once the class path has been constructed correctly, simply cd to the
j2ee-diffable directory and run:

mvn package
